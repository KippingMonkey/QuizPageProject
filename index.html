                        <p>Rick and Morty is a show that defies all expectations. You might think you know what’s about to come next, but there’s
                    always a new character, a plot twist, a planet or universe that you could never have predicted.
                    
                    That’s part of its charm, but also part of what makes it so challenging to contain in a series of facts. But if you’re a
                    true Rick and Morty fan with the brilliance of Rick and the adoration of Morty, you will have a handle on every last
                    detail of the show, whether it’s the bizarre catchphrases of Rick or the horrific failures of Jerry (please do not
                    channel Jerry on this quiz though or you will definitely fail).
                    
                    Grab your nearest Morty, head into an alternate dimension, and find some cool aliens! It’s time to do some Rick and
                    Morty trivia and only the Rickest of Ricks will be able to pass.</p>
